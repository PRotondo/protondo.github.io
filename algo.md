<h3 id='description'>Description</h3>
All contemporary programming languages offer implementations of classical algorithms and classical data structures such as lists, hash tables, sorting, etc. 
These are basic building blocks that are used to develop larger programs. Efficient algorithms for dealing with such issues have been known for several decades, since the beginning of computing,
often with several efficient variants proposed in the literature.
When developers of a programming language choose to implement a particular algorithm, such as their generic array sort, they have a wide choice of solutions.
In addition to the constraints of their language, they use various performance tests to guide their decision.
Sometimes engineers innovate and go off the beaten track to propose completely new solutions. Performance testing
is not easy to perform at this level of genericity (language designers do not know in which contexts their language will be used).
In this context our project adopts the following approach:
1. Examine the source code of different programming languages (Java, PHP, Python, . . . ) to identify
surprising or questionable choices, or innovations.
2. Propose probabilistic scenarios that model realistic behaviours for the use of these algorithms.
3. Conduct a precise mathematical study of the behaviour of the algorithms studied in the various
scenarios.
4. Confirm the efficiency of certain algorithms, reveal the weaknesses of others and possibly propose improvements
